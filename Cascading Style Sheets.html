<!--it goes step by step
(i) external CSS
(ii)internal CSS
(iii) inline CSS-->

<!--
    Four main categories:
    (i) Position 
        - if the same property has two values assigned then both the values get applied, but simply 
        the second property replaces the first one and hence that is visible
        - basically however lower, that value gets used even if it is in another selector.
        - lower the more important it is
    (ii) Specificity
        - how specific a selector is in terms of the element it is applied to
        - level of specificity from least to most:
            - element selector
            - class selector -> since multiple elements can have the same class
            - attribute selector 
            - id selector -> since it is unique to every element
    (iii) Type
        - type of CSS
        - most to least relevant
            - Inline
            - Internal
            - External
    (iv) Importance
        - we add !important keyword
        - when we add this, this ensures that this is the most important rule relevant to this.
